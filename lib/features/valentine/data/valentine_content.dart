You’re not one thing, but many blended into one person, showing different sides at any given moment and I love it so much. \n \n You have so many varied interests, talking about the history of politics and how their decisions affect us greatly today, and then tomorrow you’re talking about your favorite Webtoon you’re currently reading. (Shout out to Flatmates with Benefits and remarried Empress).  \n \nYou are a multifaceted baddie, my queen and I wouldn’t change that about you for anything.',

I had seen you from afar and told myself you were extremely beautiful, and now even more so. \n \nBut that day it was your laugh, you were talking about how you wanted to marry an Arab man so they could spend money on you, and all I could see was you smile, joy and laughter and there and then, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. \n\nIt may have taken me many more months to ask you out, but from that day there was no going back for me.',

For me, it ’s when it’s just us two together with no one else around, cuddled up and doing what we do. \n\nWatching a movie, sleeping, or even eating a meal. Just being in your presence and being able to forget about the world around me, is always such a wonderful things to experience.',
